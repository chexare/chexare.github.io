								Securities law in the U.S. dates back to the 1850s when individual states began regulating the growing trade of railroad stocks in an attempt to protect investors from financial fraud. Despite the implementation of Dodd Frank in 2002, and increased regulation following the financial crisis of 2008, fraud and the motivations for fraud continue to increase unabated. Whether motivated by the need to meet earnings expectations, hide a company’s deteriorating financial condition, bolster performance prior to an equity or debt financing, or increase executive compensation−when the fraud is exposed, equity and bond values collapse and investors suffer the consequences. No matter how talented and disciplined an investor may be; losses due to fraud and other misconduct are an unfortunate fact of life.<br><br>
								A certain portion of manipulation and misrepresentation of company performance is securities fraud, which is so egregious that the Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutes some offenders civilly. But only a small portion of corporate wrongdoing ever gets exposed by regulators.<br><br>
								McKeige Law is a first class law firm that advises clients regarding potential fraud claims and avenues for case prosecution. There are many choices and decisions that investors must make when confronted with colorable claims for investor losses.  Claims may or may not have merit.Cases can be brought as class actions or individually, under federal and/or state law or in a foreign country. Mckeige Law uses rigorous investigation and case analysis is essential to help clients decide which cases to bring and which not to bring. A law firm that will put its client’s interests first and efficiently and successfully help its clients navigate these choices is indispensable.<br><br>
								Clients with specific claims involving a class action also turn to McKeige Law to shepherd their cases and ensure that they are well litigated.
