									There is an insatiable drive for profits, wealth and power, too often without regard to what is right, or legal. Losses often go unaddressed. Fiduciary responsibilities are ignored. Regulators are ineffective. Bad actors take the money and deal with possible consequences later. No matter how talented and disciplined an investor might be – losses due to fraud and other misconduct are an unfortunate fact of life.

									Doug is an attorney and corporate advisor with more than a decade of experience prosecuting some of the most complex and high-profile securities actions in modern times. He built and was co-managing partner of the most highly regarded and significant plaintiff securities litigation practices in the U.S. Doug and his handpicked team vetted hundreds of potential claims for the clients of the firm from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. These clients included public pension funds, hedge funds, private equity firms, high net worth investors and, equally important, hardworking Americans saving for their retirements. Utilizing his extensive knowledge of securities markets and market participants along with deep research and analysis of each situation, Doug counseled clients regarding potential claims and avenues for case prosecution. Ultimately the firm and its clients commenced and prosecuted over 50 cases in federal and state courts throughout the U.S. that were underwritten and commenced by Doug’s New Matter team.
									<br><br>
									The cases were litigated to uniformly successful conclusions with an aggregate value in excess of $12 Billion.<br><br>
									Today, Doug combines his two-decade record of legal experience with a six-year record as a hedge fund Managing Director helping to grow two billion-dollar-plus hedge funds where he had daily experience with macroeconomic themes, company specific opportunities and trade implementation across all asset classes (equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, and commodities), long and short, and using derivatives across all major geographies.<br><br>
									Doug earned his B.A. in economics at Tufts University, cum laude and his J.D. from Tulane Law School, magna cum laude, Order of the Coif. He was articles editor of the <i>Tulane Law Review</i>.
