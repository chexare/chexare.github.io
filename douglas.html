								Douglas McKeige started his career at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison as a defense lawyer and then practiced for 15 years at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, LLP, where he quickly became a senior and co managing partner of the firm.  Based on his strong analytic skill set, excellent communication abilities, broad market knowledge and an unmatched talent for bringing the best people together for any situation, McKeige was at the center of the growth and incomparable success of both Bernstein Litowitz and its clients.  

								McKeige was the sole and senior partner responsible for client development, case investigation, client retention, and case design and initiation.   He invented “Portfolio Monitoring Services” for firm clients in the late 1990s, now imitated. He recruited and nurtured the most talented and effective lawyers and partners in the firm. He created and ran the firm’s client conferences (also imitated) and he was a frequent speaker at national pension fund conferences.  The firm went from a dozen lawyers to over 50, grew its institutional client base from nil to dozens, and the firm recovered over $12 billion for its clients in a series of low and high profile cases that fundamentally changed the world of securities litigation.

								Mr. McKeige graduated from Tufts University with a B.A. in Economics, cum laude, and he received his J.D. from Tulane Law School, magna cum laude, Order of the Coif.  He was also a member of the Tulane Law Review and Articles Editor.
