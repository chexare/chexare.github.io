									Douglas McKeige brings unparalleled knowledge, experience and talent to firm clients to investigate, assess, commence and prosecute meritorious claims for investor and other losses. Doug built and was co-managing partner of the most highly regarded and significant plaintiff securities litigation practice in the U.S.  He and his team vetted hundreds of potential claims for the clients of the firm from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.  These clients included public pension funds, hedge funds, private equity firms, high net worth investors and, equally important, hardworking Americans saving for their retirements. Utilizing his extensive knowledge of securities markets and market participants along with deep research and analysis of each situation, Doug counseled clients regarding potential claims and avenues for case prosecution. Ultimately the firm and its clients commenced and prosecuted more than 50 cases in federal and state courts throughout the U.S. that were underwritten and commenced by Mr. McKeige’s New Matter team. The cases were litigated to successful conclusions with an aggregate value in excess of $12 Billion.<br><br>
									Today, Doug combines his two-decade record of legal experience with a six-year record as a hedge fund Managing Director helping to grow two billion-dollar-plus hedge funds. He had daily experience with macroeconomic themes, company specific opportunities and trade implementation across all asset classes (equities, fixed income, foreign exchange and commodities), long and short, and using derivatives across all major geographies.<br><br>
